# Agenda

1. What is Neutron?
  * what is it for in Openstack world?
  * overview
2. Neutron server in details:
  * functions of Neutron server
  * main components of Neutron server
3. Neutron agents:
  * L2 agents (openvswitch, linuxbridge, etc.),
  * L3 agent,
  * metadata, dhcp agents.
4. Standard workflow between Nova and Neutron
5. Network scenarios example(s)

### Neutron is Networking as a Service for Openstack

???
From openstack wiki:
Neutron is an OpenStack project to provide "networking as a
service" between interface devices (e.g., vNICs) managed by other Openstack
services (e.g., nova).

class: center, workflow

# Standard workflow between Nova and Neutron

.left_side_list[
1. User creates instance in Nova (nova boot),
2. nova-compute is spawning instance on compute node and call Neutron API to
   create new port (like neutron port-create ...)
]

2. nova-compute is spawning instance on compute node and call Neutron API to
   create new port (like neutron port-create ...)
3. neutron-server creates port in desired network, allocate IP for this port and try
   to bind port with one of enabled mechanism drivers

4. nova-compute receives from Neutron informations about new port and prepare
   to connect tap device (e.g. create bridge)
5. neutron-server notify L2 agent and DHCP agent about new port
6. nova-compute starts instances and pause it for a while

7. Neutron L2 agent connects port to L2 network (vlan tagging, openflow rules, etc.) and notify neutron-server that port is ACTIVE
8. neutron-server notify nova-api that port for instance is ready, nova-compute can then unpause instance
